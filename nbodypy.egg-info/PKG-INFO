Description: # Welcome to nbodypy, a python packaged aimed at reading and analysing the results of NBODY star cluster simulations. 
        
        # The structure of the code is as follows:
        # Read in data from a star cluster simulation (various routines are already written in load_cluster.py, and a custom read in function is easily built
        # Use data from simulation to define a StarCluster class (cluster.py)
        # -- Basic class consists of only id's, masses, positions and velocities of stars
        # -- Class can be defined with or without some initial information (orbit, stellar evolution, unit information, binaries) if available
        # -- If the necessary conversions are given, StarCluster can easily have the units and reference frame shifted
        # -- Key parameters, like total mass, half-mass radius, etc are automatically calculated when class is defined or updated
        # Once a StarCluster has been defined, various operations and functions are in place to manipulate the data and/or calculation key properties (operations.py, functions.py, profiles.py)
        # A plotting package is also setup (plots.py) to make standard figures (position, density profile)
